<p>“Dear Miss, what can I do for you?”<br>“Oh…… I have heard that you are specialized in helping people solve problems, you are a qualified psychiatrist……”<br>“Dare not guarantee to cure all mental problems. Yet the certificates on the wall behind me are all real.”<br>“So I came to you.”<br>“Your problem is?”<br>“About love. ‘Women are born for love.’ What do you think of this idea?”<br>“‘Life is dear, love is dearer. ’ This is especially true for women.”<br>“Follow love and proceed without hesitation is not wrong, right?”<br>“It can always be forgiven when a woman makes any mistake chasing love.”<br>“Love ends up in marriage, doesn’t it?”<br>“Generally speaking, yes.”<br>“But they’re not the same……”<br>“Love is romantic, marriage is realistic.”<br>“But romance shouldn’t be hindered by reality, is it?”<br>“If a man loves one, yet he gives up because of parents’ oppositions or for the sake of money, it will be a great pity.”</p>
 <blockquote class="blockquote-center"><p>2 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Do you have anything to say to me?”<br>“I…… Must I say something?”<br>“Psychological problems must be resolved or the consequences of accumulation are serious. That’s our rule here. If you don’t say anything at all, how can we help you?”<br>“Well……I heard that your learning is profound and immense, I want to discuss……some philosophical problems.”<br>“If there is anything in the world that can be described as profound knowledge, it must be philosophy.”<br>“Actually, what I want to talk about is not philosophy, it’s a philosopher. How much do you know about Freud?”<br>“His research is too numerous to mention.”<br>“Oedipus complex……”<br>“Really it’s not philosophy.”<br>“What do you think of it?”<br>“I do not quote any of his theories, just my views. I think it’s normal, even so the Oedipus complex can be said to be an animal instinct. The Encyclopedia of animals has introduced a duck. The male duck always looks for his spouse modeling after his mother.”<br>“Is this a common phenomenon?”<br>“Yes, men often have this affection.”<br>“But shouldn’t parents be treated equally?””<br>“A boy loves his mother more than he loves his father. It’s not unusual even after he grows up.”<br>“Extreme, isn’t it?”<br>“If you are suffering from certain stimuli, you will be more strongly defended.”<br>“If the reaction has its cause, one cannot be too radical in matters like this?”<br>“Motherhood is more glorious than anything, even human nature and reason. anyone harmful to the mother is the enemy of the son.”</p>
  <blockquote class="blockquote-center"><p>3 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“You look very sad, madam.”<br>“Yes. I have a lot of questions that I can’t figure out.”<br>“For example?”<br>“What others think of me……”<br>“Dante said, ‘go your own way and let others talk.’”<br>“I’m not so easy. But other people seem to think so, and they think that what they say doesn’t hurt anyone else, so they are irresponsible to……”<br>“The world does have a lot of prejudices. For example, they think the stepmother is an old witch who enjoys abusing the children of ex-wife and also prefers to murder her husband. If a young lady marries an old man, it’s only for money.”<br>“In fact, there are many possibilities and helplessness.”<br>“If no one makes allowance for you, just be considerate of yourself.”<br>“Comfort myself?”<br>“Not only on the psychological level, but also into action, for example, try to fight for something.”<br>“But I hate being predicted. They must be as complacent as seers: ‘look, she is just what we said. This is the human nature.’ Why not the different background, but the same way?”<br>“All roads lead to Rome? It happens a lot. Don’t be afraid. Nobody knows the inside story. Isn’t it wonderful that there’s one thing only you know in the world?  Think about what you really want.”</p>
 <blockquote class="blockquote-center"><p>4 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“You don’t look very well. Relax. Don’t be nervous.”<br>“I’ve come to talk to you about the choice.”<br>“Em?”<br>“Family and love, which do you think is more important?”<br>“Different people have different views.”<br>“People always say ‘the hate of the wife being abducted’ and ‘the revenge of the father being killed’, which seems to be the most intolerable. But they also say, ‘brothers are like hands while wives are like clothes.’ I do not know which one is right.”<br>“Chinese people, if they have a theory, there must be an opposite one, it really causes some annoying headaches.”<br>“What should I do……”<br>“I can’t give a specific suggestion, just a personal opinion. The ancient Chinese values faithfulness, and on the account of the low status of women, love is so deep, even hard to speak out, so it produces the second kind of argument. But we are civilized westerners, right?”</p>
 <blockquote class="blockquote-center"><p>5 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“How’s the investigation going?”<br>“The famous Mr. Fog, got rich based on his ex-wife’s fortune and then was widowed by accident. Two years ago, he married a woman who was the younger brother’s girlfriend. If he dies before he changes his will next week, we can get four incomes at the same time. Your peers call you ‘scholar’, that really makes sense.”<br>“Remember, knowledge is always useful.”</p>
